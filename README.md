# CaveExplorer
Tiny 2D Platformer done while learning Unity

This little project was a fun adventure for discovering and getting familiar with unity and all its components.

It helped me consolidate my code organization skills while having fun building this small platformer.
I strangely seem to love doing ///summaries.

Getting to know Unity was and still is a delight, I feel more confident about tackling real and bigger projects now.

I inserted some singleton training in the project, for persistence across all the game session, and also, lost myself in the fun it was to design your own AIs from scratch.

Trying to make them overly aggressive towards the player was especially fun.

All in all, a really good experience, that I will always remember, and .. by the way..

I do think I have the world record, as of now ;)
